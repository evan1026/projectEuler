projectEuler
============

My solutions to project euler problems, written in c++.

If you're using bash, compiling the code is simple, as long as you have gcc installed:

    $ cd projectEuler
    $ compile <project number>
    $ ./project<number>.o
    
Note that compile takes just the number of the project, because I'm lazy like that.
