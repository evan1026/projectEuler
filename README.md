projectEuler
============

My solutions to project euler problems.

They're all precompiled (when applicable), but if it doesn't work, just recompile it youself.

If you're using bash and the code is in c++, compiling the code is simple, as long as you have gcc installed:

    $ cd projectEuler
    $ compile <project number>
    $ ./project<number>
    
Note that compile takes just the number of the project, because I'm lazy like that.
